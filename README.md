# Pursuit For Escape: Console Labyrinth

This is a dungeon-escaping game that can be played in the console. I got the idea of this game from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVWckBaB5xo&list=PLSPw4ASQYyynKPY0I-QFHK0iJTjnvNUys&index=29&ab_channel=MakingGamesWithBen).

The main game logic is, player should roam around and collect all the available artifacts, avoiding enemies so that the escape gate opens and player can escape the dungeon.

This game is still under development. In the current state, there is only level. Because the levels are intented to be saved in files, they can be easily edited or even new levels can added and played. But level creation and editing should be done according to this [format](files/level_format.txt). Otherwise expected behavior cannot be achieved.

Currently available features - 

- A welcome menu.

- Player can roam around, collect artifacts and escape.

- A camera which is centered according to player's position and shows a certain area of the level at a time.

- Game interface with main game view, player info, controls, and legend.
